Research can be conducted by villagers living in the area to better understand nearby fauna, flora, mineral, and physical phenomena.

Research unlocks certain items and objects the player would otherwise be unable to obtain, or can uncover knowledge that may be difficult to discover for the player.

## Locality
One way a villager may be able to research a subject is by living physically near it. For example, a villager living in the desert would be able to suggest researching sand, and would eventually be able to uncover new types of glass.

## Samples
Another way a villager can do research on a subject is if the player collects samples for them. This might be used for collecting things that the villager, even if they are living in the correct area for it, might not be able to get on their own because it's not as common (certain types of plants, rare animals, etc.)

## Constructions
Some research may require certain crafting stations be present in the villager's home for their research to be conducted, like putting furnaces in a metalsmith's home. Others might require the player to build somewhat larger constructs, like a small farm nearby for the villager to test growing plants.
