# IDEAS

- Cauldron could double as a cooking pot
    - Would require cauldrons could be powered by fire
- Barrel?
    - Rain could be collected in it
- Chain together minecarts
- In "Knowledge" book, highlight whether you'd ever seen the unknown thing, or if you have and you just didn't know this fact about it

# TODO

- [ ] Fix barrel lighting
- [ ] Fix barrel breaking particles
