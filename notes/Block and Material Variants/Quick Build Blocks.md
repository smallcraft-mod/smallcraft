Some blocks are crafted from their base material, into blocks of different shape, but the same material. For example, oak wood planks can be crafted into oak wood slabs, oak wood stairs, oak wood fences, oak wood gates, oak wood signs, oak wood hanging signs, oak wood doors, oak wood trap doors, etc.

Having to craft each of these blocks means they all take up room in the inventory, and crafting them so that you can place the correct kind of item takes time.

The new idea would be to hold simply the *material* in your hand, and be able to quickly build items from those materials that you possess.

Not all blocks can be quick-crafted, but ones that are simply built from the same type of base material can be.

## Materials
The following materials are grouped by type, which informs what types of detailing and forms they're allowed to take. Materials can never stack with each other.
